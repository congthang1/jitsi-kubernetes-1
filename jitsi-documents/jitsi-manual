INSTALLING JITSI-MEET ON UBUNTU 18.04

Jitsi Meet Overview
Jitsi Meet is an open-source video conferencing solution, providing virtual meeting rooms for remote team meetings. The sofware provides high video and audio quality and supports fully encrypted connections using TLS/SSL and Let’s Encrypt certificates.
The tool provides features similary to commercial solutions, including:
    • Sharing of desktops, presentations, and more
    • Inviting users to a conference via a simple, custom URL
    • Trading messages and emojis while video conferencing, with integrated chat.
Requirements
    • You have a Virtual Instance runnning Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04 LTS)
    • You have a domain or subdomain pointed to your Compute Instance

STEP-1:  Configure a the hostname of the server corresponding to your domain / subdomain name:
sudo su
hostnamectl set-hostname omniwyse-jitsi
#sed -i 's/^127.0.1.1.*$/127.0.1.1 omniwyse-jitsi.devopsk8s.cf omniwyse-jitsi/g' /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1 omniwyse-jitsi.devopsk8s.cf omniwyse-jitsi" >> /etc/hosts

STEP-2: Install a Nginx server before installing Jitsi Meet. The Nginx server will serve as a reverse proxy for the Jitsi web interface. The Jitsi installation tool will take care of the configuration of Nginx.

apt update
apt install -y nginx
systemctl enable nginx.service
systemctl start nginx.service

STEP-3: Download the APT key and setup the repositories of Jitsi, to install the software via apt:

wget -qO - https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | apt-key add -
sh -c "echo 'deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list"
apt update -y

STEP-4: Launch the installation of Jitsi Meet:

apt install -y jitsi-meet


During the installation you will be prompted to:
    • Enter the FQDN of your instance. For example jitsi.mydomain.tld and press Enter:


Choose the SSL certificate option Generate a new self-signed certificate (You will later get a chance to obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate) and press Enter.

STEP-5: Run the script /usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh to obtain a Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate for your instance:
/usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh

During certificate request, you are being asked to enter your e-mail address to receive notifications regarding your certificate.

STEP-6: Your private Jitsi Meet instance is ready for a first conference call. Open a Web-browser and type the FQDN of your instance, for example: https://jitsi.mydomain.tld.




Enter a name for your conference and press Go to enter the conference room. It is now possible to share the link, to set a password, configure the audio and video quality and more for the conference.

Important: Jitsi requires access to your camera and microphone. Authorize the use of these devices on your computer when prompted to do so by your web browser.
